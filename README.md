# Introduction
## The cellular components of tumors and their microenvironment play pivotal roles in tumor progression, patient survival, and the response to cancer treatments. Our contribution, scBeacon, is a novel tool that derives cell type signatures by integrating and clustering multiple scRNA-seq datasets to extract signatures for deconvolving unrelated tumor datasets on bulk samples. By employing scBeacon on the TCGA cohort, we find previously unrecognized cellular and molecular attributes within specific tumor categories, many with patient outcome relevance. We developed a tumor cell-type map (TCT) to visually depict the relationships among TCGA samples based on the cell-type inferences.
